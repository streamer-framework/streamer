##Several thresholds accepted separated by comma, one per monitored metric. If only 1 value, it will apply to all metrics 
###Parameters for ACE, PINAW, PINRW 
threshold.threshold =  0.32,0.18,0.2

##Several thresholds accepted separated by comma, one per monitored metric. If only 1 value, it will apply to all metrics
